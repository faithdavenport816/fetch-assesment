Dear Jane Doe, 

Hello! I hope you are doing well. Over the past week, I have been evaluating the new data sources provided to us, which are related to our brand inventory, users, and receipts. I hope to integrate these new data sources into our existing infrastructure, to enable improved decision-making and reporting, but first I have a series of questions that I think your team is suited to answer! I appreciate your time in advance and am happy to schedule a meeting to talk through any of these if useful.    

### Initial Questions & Clarifications
* Should all purchased products be associated with a unique barcode? Are there any products that should not have a barcode?
* Should all products be associated with PartnerProduct and/or MetaBrite information?
* Should Fetch Staff members have user accounts or only consumers?
* Should Users be unique across purchases?
* Do "brands" refer to individual products, or rather, to a type of product manufactured by a particular company under a particular name?
* Are consumers allowed to return products, and if so, will we receive that data?
* How are Brand and Category Codes assigned?
  
### Data Quality Concerns


### Scale & Optimization Planning
* Will barcodes change over time?
* Will prices stay the same over time?
