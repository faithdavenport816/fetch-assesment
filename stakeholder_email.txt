Dear Jane Doe, 

Hello! I hope you are doing well. Over the past week, I have been evaluating the new data sources provided to us, which are related to our brand inventory, users, and receipts. I hope to integrate these new data sources into our existing infrastructure, to enable improved decision making and reporting, but first I have a series of questions that I think your team is suited to answer! I appreciate your time in advance, and am happy to schedule a meeting to talk through any of these if useful.    


What questions do you have about the data?
How did you discover the data quality issues?
What do you need to know to resolve the data quality issues?
What other information would you need to help you optimize the data assets you're trying to create?
What performance and scaling concerns do you anticipate in production and how do you plan to address them?
